# EnrichedBarcode

Annotate persistence barcodes with data attributes on simplices.

## Dependencies and requirements

This code depends on a persistent (co)homology software `Dionysus` (https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/) and some common Python packages: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`.

## Getting started

This can be installed by running ``pip install $ThisDir``.

A jupyter notebook is included in the examples folder showing various examples.

See the branch "python3" for software in Python 3 with more recent dependencies.

## Acknowledgement
